Reflection

For this assignment, I successfully met all the basic requirements and added a few extra features. I dedicated a significant amount of time to research and planning to bring my ideas to life. Since it was my first time working with logins, I focused on understanding authentication. Through my research, I learned about using an authentication helper file to store and retrieve user data. While researching further, I also discovered Axios, a popular library, which I decided to incorporate into my project to improve API management and enhance code efficiency.

In exploring React Router, I came across the useNavigate hook, which seemed useful and I was eager to try it out in my project. I really appreciate how it simplifies the code and makes it more organised.

The platform I’m building allows users to share their evil deeds, with allowing others to react with an “evil laugh” (instead of a like button) and comment on the posts. I created a ranking system where users earn notoriety points based on engagement with their posts, the idea was the more engagement the user gets the more notorious they become. As users gain points, they level up and receive a new title that reflects their notoriety. Additionally, I aimed to implement a leaderboard that would display the top ten users based on their points. 

Due to the complexity of this assignment, I didn’t have time to implement the functionality for reactions or comments yet. However, with dummy data, I have been able to display a leaderbboard and the different ranks. Also Users are still able to post deeds to the deed log, adding a description and choosing a category.

I’m excited to continue developing this project to achieve my original vision. Once it’s complete, I plan to create a similar platform called "Hero Hub," where users can share their good deeds.
